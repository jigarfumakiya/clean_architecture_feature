# Installation

Make sure you have Mason installed. If you don't have it installed, follow
the [installation guide](https://docs.brickhub.dev/category/getting-started) to get started.

Once you have Mason installed, you can add the clean_architecture_feature brick to your Mason
configuration by adding the following code to your **mason.yaml** file:

```yaml
bricks:
  clean_architecture_feature: 0.0.1
```

# Usage

To use the clean_architecture_feature brick, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
mason make clean_architecture_feature
```

## Variables ✨

The following table outlines the variables that can be used when generating a new feature folder:

| Variable | Description                | Required   | Type     |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `feature_name`   | 🏷️ Name of the feature              | `Yes`      | `string` |
| `use_bloc`   | 🧱 Determine if you need BLoC for the feature or not              | `Yes`      | `bool` |

## Output 📦

The generated folder architecture will look like this:

```
lib/
├── features
│   ├── featureName
│   │   ├── data
│   │   │   ├── datasources
│   │       │   ├── feature_name_remot_source.dart
│   │   │   ├── models
│   │       │   ├── feature_name_network.dart
│   │   │   └── repositories
│   │       │   ├── feature_name_repository_impl.dart
│   │   ├── domain
│   │   │   ├── repositories
│   │       │   ├── feature_name_repository.dart
│   │   │   └── usecases
│   │       │   ├── feature_name_use_case.dart
│   │   └── presentation
│   │       ├── bloc
│   │       │   ├── feature_name_bloc.dart
